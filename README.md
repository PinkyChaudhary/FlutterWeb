Here i made AppConstants class for colors  and Utils class for its height and width inside Widget directory. If you want  to give directly then you can. Its not compulsary to make the classses. But in big projects using of these classes makes easy to work.
AppConstants.dart for colors. For color code use Gpick tools or others from net.
Here i used network image and folders images. While using folder images no need to make changes in Pubseck.yaml file.
To use folder image, simply make an folder inside web directory and give path of it where you are using it:
##### NetworkImage("folder_name/image_name"),
